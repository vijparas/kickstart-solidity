# Kickstart Campaign Smart Contract

## Introduction
##### Kickstart is a Ethereum Based Project in which we are building smart contract to enable campaign funding.  Whenever a person wants to raise money for his project he can create a new campaign along with minimum contribution required. Any person willing to be a contributor can transfer ethereum from his account and will become a contributor. Whenever Campaign Manager needs to withdraw money from the project pool he has to raise a withdrawal request mentioning amount and address of the service provider. The contributors need to provide conscious for the withdrawl request. Conscious will be reached when atleast 50% of contributors votes in favor. Once conscious has been received the ether will be transferred to the account of service provider provided while create withdraw request.
